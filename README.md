# DigiByte-DigiFacts-JSON
A JSON file containing DigiByte DigiFacts.

### About the DigiFacts

These DigiFacts were originally created by several members of the DigiByte community back in 2021. The originals can be found [here](https://github.com/DigiByte-Core/DigiFacts). Since then, the original DigiFacts have been significantly revised and expanded over time to create the versions you see here.

### Usage

For best results download and cache the raw JSON file available here: https://raw.githubusercontent.com/saltedlolly/DigiByte-DigiFacts-JSON/main/digifacts.json

You should then periodically update your local version of this file from this address to ensure you have the latest DigiFacts. How often you do this is up to you, but at most once per day should be more than enough.

### Contributions

Contributions to this project from the community are actively encouraged. If you notice DigiFacts that are out of date or erroneous, please fork the repo and make a PR.

If you have a DigiByte project that you wish to make the community aware of, please add a new DigiFact. Be careful to use neutral wording - no marketing or advertisng is permitted, though a single DigiFact to tell the community about your project and what it offers is permitted.

URLs should ideally be included in both the content text, and in the seperate URL field. Ideally you should include only one URL per DigiFact.

Important: If you wish to insert a line break in your DigiFact, please use: \n
